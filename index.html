    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m Ezra, an aspiring Electrical and Electronic Engineer with a deep passion for technology, innovation, and automation. My journey began with a fascination for electronics, and I have since expanded my skills in Arduino, IoT, and solar-powered systems.

I am dedicated to creating practical, smart solutions that solve real-world problems. From designing energy-efficient systems to building custom smart devices, I thrive on hands-on projects that allow me to continuously learn and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

Currently, I’m expanding my skills in programming and web development to better showcase my work and collaborate on exciting projects. My goal is to contribute to sustainable tech solutions and improve everyday life through automation and intelligent design.

When I’m not tinkering with circuits or coding, you can find me diving into the world of Open Source, developing new ideas, or exploring the latest tech trends.
